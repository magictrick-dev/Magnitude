<center><h1>The PBMplus Image File Formats</h1></center>

The PBMplus file formats were developed by Jef Poskanzer as a means of
including images into e-mail messages long before such things as MIME
types were popular.  But since then they have become very popular
amongst computer graphics and computer vision people for image input
and output.<p>

The formats are extremely simple, and have absolutely no advanced
features. There is no data compression.  This simplicity makes it easy
to code programs that can read large collections of existing images or
write images that can be immediately used by others.

</p><h2>Image Types</h2>
PBMplus is actually a collection of 6 very similar formats that can be
classified in two ways: by image type and by data type. <p>

The formats describe three types of images: black and white bitmaps,
gray scale images, and full color images.</p><p>

Bitmaps are usually called PBM files and often have a
<samp>.pbm</samp> extension.  (A specific extension is <em>not</em>
required for any of the PBMplus formats.)  In this format, a
<samp>1</samp> means black and <samp>0</samp> means white.</p><p>
      
Grayscale images in the PBMplus formats are referred to as PGM files,
with a <samp>.pgm</samp> extension. Grayscale intensities are integer
values going from 0 for black up to a maximum value for white
specified in the image itself.</p><p>

Color images are called PPM files, and usually have a
<samp>.ppm</samp> extension. Pixels in PPM files are given as integer
amounts of red, green, and blue, on a scale from 0 to a maximum value
given in the file.</p><p>

The data in each image type can be stored in either ASCII or binary
form.

</p><h2>Format</h2>
Each PBMplus image file consists of a header followed by the image
data for the image.

<h2>Headers</h2>
Each PBMplus image file has a ASCII header that consists of three
parts, one of which is optional depending on the image type.

<h3>Magic</h3>
The first part of the header consists of a unique identifying string,
colloquially known as the file magic, which identifies the file as a
PBMplus image file.  The magic for these files consists of the
uppercase character <samp>P</samp>, followed by an ASCII digit 1
through 6.  These characters <em>must</em> be the first two characters
in the file.  The magic values can be summarized in the table
below:<p>

</p><center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" summary="PBMplus file magic">
  <caption>PBMplus file magic values</caption>
  <tbody><tr><td></td><td>ASCII</td><td>Binary</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B/W (pbm)</td><td><samp>P1</samp></td><td><samp>P4</samp></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Grayscale (pgm)</td><td><samp>P2</samp></td><td><samp>P5</samp></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Color (ppm)</td><td><samp>P3</samp></td><td><samp>P6</samp></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
Whitespace separates the magic characters from the sections below.  A
single new line character is often used.
    
<h3>Size</h3>
The second part of the header consists of two numerical ASCII values
that give the width and height, respectively, of the image in pixels.
    
<h3>Intensity</h3>
The last part of the header is a positive numerical ASCII value which
indicates the maximum possible value that a pixel can have.  In the
case of color images, it is the maximum value that a red, green or
blue component of a pixel may have.  In black and white images this
value is not needed.  In binary grayscale and color images (P5 and
P6), this intensity value can never be greater than 65535.  If the
maximum intensity is 255 or less, then binary files will use one byte
per intensity value.  If the maximum intensity is 256 or greater, then
two bytes will be used per intensity value.

<h3>Comments</h3>
The header of a PBMplus image is allowed to have comments, which are
ignored by a program processing the file.  Comments consist of the #
character and continue until the end of the line.  The comment may not
come before the magic.  There are no comments after the intensity
value in a binary file.  Comments are allowed in the image data
section of an ASCII file.  Multiple line comments are allowed as long
as each line starts with a # character.

<h2>Image Data and Types</h2>
The format of the image data for each image type is described below.
The image data describes the intensity values for the image pixels in
row major order.  The image origin is in the upper left hand corner
and proceeds in positive x to the right and and positive y towards the
bottom.  The first pixel value will be the pixel in the top left
corner of the image.  The next pixel value will be to the right of
that and so on until all the values of the topmost pixel row are
given.  These are followed immediately by the values of the second row
and so on until the bottom of the image is reached.
    
<h3>Black and White ASCII (P1)</h3>
After the header, the intensity values of the pixels are given as
sequences of the ASCII characters 1 and 0.  There may or may not be
white space between these characters.  The value 1 represents black
and the value 0 represents white.  Comments are allowed in the image
data.

<h3>Grayscale ASCII (P2)</h3>
After the header, the intensity values of the pixels are given as
ASCII numbers separated by whitespace. Comments are allowed in the
image data.

<h3>Color ASCII (P3)</h3>
After the header, the values of each pixel are given as 3 ASCII
numbers representing the red, green, and blue components of the
pixel. The componenets are separated by white space as are the pixel
values themselves.  Comments are allowed in the image data.

<h3>Black and White Binary (P4)</h3>
After the height of the image is given in the header, one character of
white space is allowed.  This is usually a newline character.  The
image data bytes immediately follow.  Each byte in this format
represents eight pixels, with 1 bits representing black and 0 bits
representing white.  The bits are in little-endian order, i.e., the
most significant bit is to the left and the least significant bit is
to the right.  No comments are allowed in the image data.

<h3>Grayscale Binary (P5)</h3>
After the maximum intensity value of the image is given in the header,
one character of whitespace is allowed, usually a newline character.
The image data immediately follows. No space or comments of any kind
are allowed in the image data section.  All characters are treated as
intensity values.  If the maximum intensity is 255 or less, then the
image data consist of one byte per pixel.  If the maximum intensity is
256 or greater, then two sequential bytes are used per pixel,
representing a two byte integer intensity value, with MSB first.


<h3>Color Binary (P6)</h3>
After the maximum intensity value of the image is given in the header,
exactly one character of whitespace is allowed, usually a newline
character.  The image data immediately follows, three binary integers
per pixel value.  The three integers represent the red, green and blue
values of the pixel respectively. If the maximum intensity is 255 or
less, then each channel is represented by one byte, for a total of 3
bytes per pixel.  If the intensity is 256 or greater, then two bytes
are used for each of the red, green, and blue, for a total of 6 bytes
per pixel.  When two byte intensity values are used, the most
significant byte (MSB) goes first. No space or comments of any kind
are allowed in the image data section.

<h2>Commentary</h2>
Here is a brief summary about some of the pros and cons of ASCII and
binary PBMplus files and of the format in general:

<ul>
  <li> ASCII files are <em>huge</em>.  There can be as many as 4
  bytes to describe the intensity value of a single pixel or
  component.  Color <samp>ppm</samp> images could easily have at least
  12 bytes per pixel. In ASCII <samp>pbm</samp> files there are at least
  8 bytes per pixel.</li>
  <li> This format has no means to represent indexed color images.</li>
  <li> This format has no compression.</li>
  <li> This format has no means to represent
  "transparent" values which are very useful in creating
  shaped images such as icons.</li>
  <li> ASCII files are readable by humans and can be easily
  included in generic e-mail messages.  With today's MIME types
  for e-mail attachments, this is no longer an issue.</li>
  <li> Binary files are not readable by humans.  But usually only
  the header is of human interest.</li>
</ul>
